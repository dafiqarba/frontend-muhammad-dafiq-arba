# Project Overview

## 📦 App Description

This is a simple frontend web application developed as part of a technical assessment. The app allows users to:

1. **Select a country (Negara)** from a searchable list.
2. **Select a port (Pelabuhan)** based on the selected country.
3. **Select a product/item (Barang)** based on the selected port.
4. View the **description, price, and discount** of the selected item.
5. **Edit the discount** to dynamically recalculate the total price.
6. Display the **total price** formatted in Indonesian currency.

All data is fetched from a live API and updates automatically based on user interaction.
